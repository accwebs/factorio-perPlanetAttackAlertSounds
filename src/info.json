    "description": "A silly, for-personal-use mod, that adds per-planet 'entity destroyed' alert sounds to reduce the constant toil of having to check the alert location each time it fires. Warning: ALPHA status! CAUTION: Makes some permanent force changes to games loaded with the mod active. Factorio does not auto-revert if you later disable the mod; you must first tell mod to undo the changes. Read the instructions."
